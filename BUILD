1. run exampleCollector.sh 

If it does not crash, things are quite fine. 
You may run the libipfix exampleExporter concurrently.

== Compiling from source ==
1. run buildJavaFirst.sh
2. open buildCSecond.sh and adjust the parameters in the first lines
3. run buildCSecond.sh

== Using the jIPFIX API ==

There is javadoc generated HTML documentation in the doc/ folder


Enjoy.
Remember, things are far from being bulletproof. A great many checks are 
still missing in the code. Feel free to fix and improve. Feedback is very
