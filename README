= jipfix - a java wrapper for the ipfix library =

This library is to be considered unstable. 

== Bugs ==

 * NTP and UINT data elements are still returned in (signed) BigInteger format. 
 * ~~Float data elements are currently not supported. They crash the library.~~ Fixed!

 * {{{git clone http://relet.net/svn/jipfix/.git jipfix}}}
 * make (or read the BUILD file, if it does not work).

 * Have a look at the main method in jIPFIX.java and the ExampleCollector class.
